FOR LOOPS

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}


start, end, increment - how much do you want to go up each time
***** anything in between { } means this is when you execute that code.

***** for increment ... use syntax +=  DONT FORGET EQUALS SIGN!



FUNCTIONS

//Define Function
function sum(x,y) {
  console.log(x + y);
}

//CALL
sum(20,999);

X AND Y can be named ANYTHING



Visually in developer tools the color is different if you compare a number vs a string;

Don't forget the comma when writing objects.

ARRAY'S start at zero! BUT .length starts at 1!

Whenever you see an array you are probably going to use a for loop.

Two things that are false evaluate to false.
console.log(false && false);

double equals checks for value
triple equals checks for value and type.
ALWAYS use triple equals.


to check what data type a variable is typeof
console.log(typeof answer);
